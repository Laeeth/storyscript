Welcome to Storyscript's documentation!
=======================================

StoryScript is a language for orchestrating micro-services in an algorithmic
program.

The goal is to write high-level logic into a **StoryScript** which orchestrates
containers. These containers (typically micro-services or functions) execute
low-level functions passing the output back into the Story.
